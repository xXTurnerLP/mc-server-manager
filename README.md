# Server Manager | Version: 1.0 | Author: turner#6040

This datapack provides the ability for server admins to manage their servers more easily, it has alot of features! And is going to be updated more and more!

## Requirements
1. You need to run your server as **Vanilla 1.16**. (Any 1.16.x works, also it is only tested on bukkit and vanilla, so **CraftBukkit and Vanilla works!**)
1. You need to set *function-permission-level* in **server.properties** to **level 4** ([Tutorial how to do that](LINK_TO_WIKI))
1. You need to be operator on the server in order to use the datapack. ([Tutorial how to do that](LINK_TO_WIKI))
1. You ***should not*** use any function under the *_private* namespace. Doing so, could cause damage to the datapack's working data or **your world**.

Killing entities and groups of entities |
